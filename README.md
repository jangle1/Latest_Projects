# Latest_Projects
This repo contains all the projects I've been working on recently or I'm working on now.
Since I work as a Data Scientist, I have been doing various projects at work. 
The projects I work on in my spare time will appear in this folder.

1. CV_Live_Emotion_Recognition
 - This is a Computer Vision model based on convolutional neural networks.
   In this project, using facial images with visible emotions, I teach the model to recognise emotions on the faces of people sitting in front of a live camera.
   The project is still in production, but in the next free moment I will finish it in a sufficient version to show it.
